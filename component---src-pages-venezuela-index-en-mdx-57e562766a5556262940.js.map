Many of those who were unable to legally emigrate across Bolívar state from north to south and into Brazil are now there. And to be there is to leave without having done it. Venezuela is just a couple of minutes away from Cañamú by boat. You do not need a passport. Not even an ID.

Right now, nobody has it,” he said in January 2020. “Let me explain: when December approaches, everyone comes out of `}{`[the mines]`}{`. Then sales `}{`[of mercury]`}{` stop until March, which is when the machines start up again. But it is a good business because a liter of that is worth a quite a bit of gold .”`}</p>\n    <p>{`When Etheringbang was still a largely unknown territory for many Venezuelans, mercury trafficking from Guyana to Venezuela was the norm. From Georgetown, Guyana’s capital—which sits on the Atlantic coast of the country, east of the Essequibo River—the mercury distribution chain began, gradually reaching Etheringbang.`}</p>\n    <p>{`But does it mean that the route between Guayana Esequiba and the state of Bolívar has been one of the most important and frequent points for the entry of quicksilver to Venezuela? Not necessarily. The main reason was the difficulty of its transport, since crossing Guyana from east to west increased costs.`}</p>\n    <p>{`That changed in 2019. That year, an airline equipped with single-engine aircrafts, opened a route between Georgetown and Etheringbang. The conditions were established for an increase in the volumes of contraband. In 2013, before Guyana signed onto the Minamata Convention, annual mercury imports averaged 70 tons. Since then, international purchases from suppliers in Russia, India, Turkey, the United States, and the United Kingdom have decreased stabilizing at just 20 tons per year. For now, trade and transport of mercury is still legal in Guyana—at least until the ban, announced in the wake of Minamata, is finalized.`}</p>\n    <p>{`But the global economic slowdown due to Covid-19 stopped the opportunities for those who were thinking of smuggling mercury to Venezuela more frequently by air. If talking about real numbers regarding smuggling is already complicated, delving into a projection of what would have happened without a pandemic is, of course, pure speculation. Beyond conjecture, it can be said that there is small-scale mercury trafficking from Etheringbang to the Venezuelan riverbanks.`}</p>\n    <p><span parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"1200px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<span parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"paddingBottom\": \"75%\",\n            \"position\": \"relative\",\n            \"bottom\": \"0\",\n            \"left\": \"0\",\n            \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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')\",\n            \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          }\n        }}></span>{`\n  `}<picture parentName=\"span\">{`\n        `}<source parentName=\"picture\" {...{\n            \"srcSet\": [\"/static/5b05cda5570cc37f6bbfbea02bc28988/e93cc/IMG_20200124_120917.webp 300w\", \"/static/5b05cda5570cc37f6bbfbea02bc28988/b0544/IMG_20200124_120917.webp 600w\", \"/static/5b05cda5570cc37f6bbfbea02bc28988/68fc1/IMG_20200124_120917.webp 1200w\"],\n            \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\",\n            \"type\": \"image/webp\"\n          }}></source>{`\n        `}<source parentName=\"picture\" {...{\n            \"srcSet\": [\"/static/5b05cda5570cc37f6bbfbea02bc28988/73b64/IMG_20200124_120917.jpg 300w\", \"/static/5b05cda5570cc37f6bbfbea02bc28988/3ad8d/IMG_20200124_120917.jpg 600w\", \"/static/5b05cda5570cc37f6bbfbea02bc28988/6c738/IMG_20200124_120917.jpg 1200w\"],\n            \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\",\n            \"type\": \"image/jpeg\"\n          }}></source>{`\n        `}<img parentName=\"picture\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n            \"src\": \"/static/5b05cda5570cc37f6bbfbea02bc28988/6c738/IMG_20200124_120917.jpg\",\n            \"alt\": \"Guyana’s mercury has been cheaper in Eterimbán for a few months due to the opening of an air route to Georgetown.\",\n            \"title\": \"Guyana’s mercury has been cheaper in Eterimbán for a few months due to the opening of an air route to Georgetown.\",\n            \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"width\": \"100%\",\n              \"height\": \"100%\",\n              \"margin\": \"0\",\n              \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n              \"position\": \"absolute\",\n              \"top\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\"\n            }\n          }}></img>{`\n      `}</picture>{`\n    `}</span>{` `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Guyana’s mercury has been cheaper in Eterimbán for a few months due to the opening of an air route to Georgetown.`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`A walk through the hamlet is enough to ask about the mercury and bargain for it. “It’s ten gramas `}{`[of gold]`}{` for a kilo,” says a Venezuelan who works for a Guyanese vendor who owns a kiosk that displays food, chimó (a type of chewing tobacco), and quicksilver.

About the price, I ask for 11 gramas per kilo. If you want more than a kilo, I’ll lower the price for you. If you want a full bottle, it’s 8.5 gramas. There are five kilos. And the one that comes from Georgetown is a flask that is sealed and pure. Here (in Guyana) it’s not that it’s legal at all, because to be legal you must have a mining license to show that you have a concession. But as this area is a mining area, it’s normal.” The monthly amount depends on demand. There’s no fixed amount.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Buying mercury in Guyana has a great advantage, according to Perez: It’s pure mercury.

You'd be better off if you killed someone than if they catch you with a kilo of quicksilver. There is nothing that can save you. From here `}{`[from Guyana]`}{` you buy it and take it to the mines near San Martín and there is no problem. But if you go further into Venezuela and they grab you, you have no recourse and it’s a real pain in the ass to get out. Five or ten thousand dollars. It’s better to buy it here, grab it and get out. And by the way it’s cheaper: In Tumeremo, you have to pay 10 or 12 gramas for a kilo.” That’s one reason why many don’t consider trafficking mercury from Guyana to Bolívar on the San Martín de Turumbán route to be lucrative. The absence until recently of an air route between Etheringbang and Georgetown was another. On top of that obstacle, the coronavirus arrived. In this regard, Junior Pernía, who owns a restaurant with three plastic tables and an austere hotel with mats and fans in Cañamú, outlines the scale.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“You can sell the quicksilver brought from Venezuela here for 14 grams per kilo. The mercury from here `}{`[Guyana]`}{` is nine. But that is now. Before, it was more expensive because there were no flights, so it was cheaper to bring it from Tumeremo,” says the merchant from San Félix who, as an epilogue for each sentence, says: “By the mercy of God.”`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Sure profit`}</h2>\n    <p>{`By whatever route, mercury is available to anyone who requires it in any mining town in the state of Bolívar. Four years after its official ban in Venezuela, it’s still a common piece of merchandise. Miners continue to use it, polluting rivers and exposing themselves to the toxic metal, and suffering the consequences of its use. Meanwhile, the police and the military continue to profit from the bribes they’re paid by smugglers to look the other way. Nobody seems to have the slightest intention to abandon the element.`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`Meanwhile, the police and the military continue to profit from the bribes they’re paid by smugglers to look the other way.`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`“It’s all because a network of mining interests that has been here for more than 30 years has prevented that situation from being controlled,” says a Venezuelan academic and researcher, who prefers that his name be omitted. “And that is consistent with the situation in Colombia, Brazil, or Peru. We speak of the complicity of all the actors involved. We have to shed the notion that the issue is recent, because, as I said, it’s more than 30 years old. But in 2011 the issue has grown in a way that has never happened in the history of Venezuela before. There are between 300,000 and 400,000 miners between Bolívar, Amazonas, and Delta Amacuro.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`He also points out that the Orinoco Mining Arc is the culmination of the last three decades of slow and consistent devastation. It's a hidden catastrohpe. There is no data on the number of people affected by mercury. It affects the kidneys, joints, and nervous system. A highly contaminated person enters a catatonic state and dies. There are people with symptoms such as tremors in the hands, difficulties in memorizing numbers and names. It’s a potential disaster of great magnitude covered by huge interests that have spent many years preventing the studies from being done. In other countries, there are epidemiological statistics on the effects of mercury. Not here,” he concludes.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The sale—illegally, obviously—continues in 2020. In any business that buys and sells gold, customers can find bottles of mercury as well.`}</p>\n    <p>{`These transactions highlight a necessary truth of the trafficking networks. “Mercury is more profitable than gold. With gold, you can have a loss; with mercury, you cannot. It will never diminish. Unless there is control. But the Venezuelan National Guard itself distributes it. If the National Guard wanted to stop that, they would raid all those stores, and they would take so many kilos of mercury. But the traffickers pay everyone: the military and the thugs. And while you pay, you can go through those checkpoints and smuggle weapons, drugs, quicksilver. Whatever you want.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`This trafficking network that has enabled mercury, wherever it comes from, to flow through Venezuelan rivers. “The trafficked mercury has to come from different sources,” says the Venezuelan academic and researcher. “Mercury from southern Amazonas is not the same as that used in the Cuyuní basin. I have no doubt that some may come from the north of Venezuela. For example, Canada sells mercury to Cuba, which raises the question: Why does Cuba want this mercury?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Marcello Veiga, a professor of mining and the environment at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, who has studied the effects of mercury for 40 years, has the same question. Veiga was in Venezuela in 1995 as an envoy of the United Nations for Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) with one goal: To promote the reduction of the use of quicksilver in mining.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“There are more than 20 million miners around the world. It’s more profitable for a person to be a miner than a farmer. It's about legalizing and educating; giving technical assistance. The government makes laws but doesn’t provide technical assistance,” he says, and warns that the ban will not do much good. “What works, then? The education of miners, and government presence to educate the miners.`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`It’s more profitable for a person to be a miner than a farmer.

They use it saying that it's for medical use, but at that price it can’t be distilled mercury. It is clear that this mercury, either from Russia or Turkey, is of low quality. And that mercury is then smuggled to Venezuela.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`In a July 2020 report on the Orinoco Mining Arc, Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, pointed out that failing to reduce the use of mercury is “a breach of duty of the Maduro government.\"`}</p>\n    <p>{`Guyana's mercury mainly pollutes the waters of the mines near San Martín de Turumbán. The boats that move over the Cuyuní (another victim of mercury pollution) throughout the day and some of the night between Venezuela and Guyana are only one part of the international trafficking network.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Unwritten rules and norms govern the no man's land within the corridor between Bolívar state and Guayana Esequiba. The thriving region has become nearly devoid of inhabitants and the economic opportunities it once offered. But it survives by these unspoken, and unbreakable rules. It’s a bend in the meandering Cuyuní River, next to Eterimbán and a neighbor of San Martín de Turumbán, that some insist on calling Cañamú.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
