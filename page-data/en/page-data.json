The liquid metal is considered essential to extract gold sparks. But mercury pollutes fragile ecosystems and harms human health. </p> <p>One of the hidden doors to mercury entering Amazonia is the Guiana Shield region. The legal import of this toxic substance through Guyana makes it the link for smuggling to neighboring countries like Suriname, Venezuela, and Brazil, where the sale is prohibited.</p> <p>In this investigation, we dive into mercury's underworld, an obscure sector that few know, which is itself a multi-million dollar industry.</p>","map_title":"September 10th<br/>Launch of the interactive platform Mercury","map_lead":"Sign up to receive the full investigation","map_text":"<p>“MERCURY”, is a production of <a href=\"https://infoamazonia.org/\" target=\"_blank\">InfoAmazonia</a>, a network of journalists who investigate the main environmental issues in the nine countries of the Amazon.
