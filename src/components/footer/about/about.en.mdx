“MERCURY”, is a production of [InfoAmazonia](https://infoamazonia.org/), a network of journalists who investigate the main environmental issues in the nine countries of the Amazon. The investigation was conducted in four countries for over one year. The work was done in partnership with journalists from [Armando.Info](https://armando.info/) in Venezuela and [Fantástico (TV Globo)](https://g1.globo.com/fantastico/) in Brazil.  Along with this special investigation, we will launch a documentary directed by [Tom Laffay](https://www.tomlaffay.com/about/). 

The entire production is supported by the [Rainforest Journalism Fund](https://pulitzercenter.org/rainforest-journalism-fund-0) of the Pulitzer Center and ["IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) National Committee of the Netherlands (IUCN NL)](https://www.iucn.nl/en).
