The liquid metal is considered essential to extract gold sparks, but mercury pollutes fragile ecosystems and harms human health. </p> <p>One of the hidden doors for mercury to enter the Amazon is the Guiana Shield region. The legal import of this toxic substance through Guyana makes it the nexus for smuggling to neighboring countries like Suriname, Venezuela, and Brazil, where it’s been outlawed.</p> <p>In this investigation, we dive into the underworld of mercury.
