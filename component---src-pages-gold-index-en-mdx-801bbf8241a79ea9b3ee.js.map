<p>{`But quantities of gold mined in Guyana differ from how much is actually declared and traded, according to Newell Dennison, head of the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission (GGMC). “The amount of gold that is declared to the GGB does not reconcile easily with the amount of gold that our officers from GGMC ascertain as being produced from the\noperations on the ground,” he says. “We have had situations where the difference is troubling to us.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Gold production in Guyana’s small-scale gold mines contracted in 2019, according to multiple sources, due to issues with access to fuel and decreasing public investments in the sector. Yet gold declarations by dealers and exporters rose in 2019, which could represent gold coming from illegal Guyanese mines, or gold trafficked into Guyana from other countries.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In the first five months of 2020, Guyanese gold dealers declared 940 kilograms more than the same period in 2019—a nearly 27 percent increase during the COVID-19 pandemic.

El Dorado Trading exports gold to Guardian International Gold Corp in\nCanada, Tony Goetz in Belgium, and Argor-Heraeus in Switzerland. Mohamed’s Trading exports to Zee Gold DMCC in the United Arab Emirates.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Other companies, including several recognizable multinationals, then purchase the gold directly from these refineries. Argor-Heraeus, for example, sells their gold to Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Phillip Morris, Ford, and Tesla. Tony Goetz’s clients include Sony, Starbucks, and Hewlett-Packard.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Sources familiar with the companies’ practices claim that Guyanese miners working in Venezuela bring the gold to Guyana and sell it to El Dorado Trading, and that both companies occasionally buy gold directly from Venezuelan criminals on the border, referred to as sindicatos or malandros.`}</p>\n    <p>{`El Dorado Trading denied allegations that the company has purchased Venezuelan gold, and Guardian International, Tony Goetz, and Argor-Heraeus all claimed that they had no reason to believe El Dorado had sold them Venezuelan gold. “Our own standards and the legal standards in Switzerland are amongst the strictest in the world and we are absolutely determined to follow them,” Argos-Heraeus’s head of communications wrote in an email.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Mohamed’s Trading did not respond to requests for comment.`}</p>\n    <p>{`One Venezuelan gold trafficker alleges that Mohammed’s Trading, owned by Nazar Mohamed, is buying gold from the Venezuelan regime’s military leadership. “Mohamed, that one, he is the tough one over there `}{`[in Guyana]`}{`,” he says. “It’s him who is throwing dollars very hard at these people.” The trafficker claims that the military buys from the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas near a mine called Corre Gente, in the Venezuelan Bolívar state. “There is an airstrip there,” he says.`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`“From there, `}{`[the gold]`}{` illegally leaves for Guyana, they hand it over and bring dollars back.”`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`A source in a foreign intelligence service claims that Mohamed is the “main player” involved in trafficking illicit goods from Venezuela into Guyana, and then abroad. “`}{`[Mohamed]`}{` is buying Venezuelan gold, definitely he is the biggest buyer, no doubt about it.

It is not uncommon in Guyana for certain private/public groupings to combine efforts to attack others for competitive,financial or political purposes.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Regardless of the gold smuggling allegations against El Dorado Trading, Jagmohan himself has been investigated by the FBI for gold smuggling to the U.S. and he and his company are suspected of having laundered money for the terrorist organization Hezbollah. Jagmohan was stopped at the Miami airport in 2012 with 27 bars of gold he failed to declare. According to someone with knowledge of the investigation, he was fined $40,000 USD and had his visa revoked.`}</p>\n    <p>{`According to Sittlington, the SOCU has also found that individuals heavily adorned with gold jewelry smuggle gold on flights to markets in North America, such as Miami, and that bags containing gold have bypassed airport security: “In other words, there is corruption at the airport,” Sittlington adds. According to one government source, in late\n2019, officials halted an El Dorado shipment of about 125 kilograms of gold ready to take-off to Barbados. The shipment aroused suspicions after officials identified irregularities with the seal and noticed that it was scheduled to leave from an airport that is not used for official gold transports.`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`Individuals heavily adorned with gold jewelry smuggle gold on flights to markets in North America, such as Miami, and that bags containing gold have bypassed airport security:`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`Some of the gold is transited through Suriname, then brought to The Netherlands, sometimes on commercial KLM flights, before it’s taken to Belgium. KLM could not confirm or deny that it had transported gold shipments in the past due to the \"sensitive nature of the shipments,\" but added that it decided in July 2019 to no longer transport Venezuelan\ngold.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Besides trafficking Venezuelan gold, major gold buyers make hefty profits by using a different exchange rate for the U.S. Dollar than banks and the state, winning a few dollars on each gram of gold. More money is made through tax evasion. Miners sell their gold plus 8.5 percent in taxes, which El Dorado Trading and Mohamed’s Trading should pass on to the state. Oftentimes this does not happen, and the taxes paid by small-scale miners are pocketed by Guyana’s biggest gold exporters.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Despite officials’ knowledge of trafficking and tax evasion, they’ve been unable to put a stop to it. The foreign intelligence officer in Guyana complains that no legal cases can be built because of the deep corruption in Guyanese law enforcement. “The police force is part of the problem,” he says, “not part of the solution.”`}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <p>{`Not all of the gold mined or trafficked into Guyana is directly sold to international refineries. The lawlessness and uncontrolled borders of the northern Amazon mean that much of that gold goes where taxes are lowest and foreign currencies are paid.`}</p>\n    <Video url=\"https://youtube.com/embed/veX0nCa5ARQ\" mdxType=\"Video\" />\n    <p>{`On the Guyanese banks of the Corentyne River lies a small town called Corriverton. Frequent boats ferry passengers and goods across the river to Suriname, offering ample opportunities to traffickers. Showtime*, a local criminal entrepreneur with a career in gold mining and trafficking, explains how contraband economies work in a nutshell. “All I know is to go to the interior and work, bring home the gold for my family,” Showtime says. “Now I realize that if I take that gold to Suriname, I’m going to get double the amount to look after my family. So I’m going to try to be creative enough to take my gold over there.”`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`\"If I take that gold to Suriname, I’m going to get double the amount to look after my family.

Additionally, Surinamese gold shops often paid in U.S. dollars or Euros, while most—especially the smaller—Guyanese gold shops only offer GYD.`}</p>\n    <p>{`As the price of gold shot up over the last two years, gold shops in Suriname’s capital city of Paramaribo increased their revenues. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, some smaller and independent gold shops in the center of Paramaribo processed one or two kilograms a day and mainly bought small quantities from inland miners. But there were, and still are, bigger players on the market. One of the larger gold buyers with an export license claimed to have bought up to 50 kilograms a day, a market value of more than $3 million USD, from gold shops throughout the capital.`}</p>\n

Most of the gold coming from Suriname’s small- and medium-scale mines has to pass through the KSMH, a joint venture between Kaloti's Dubai refinery, Surinamese business owners, and the state. Kaloti Precious Metals owns a majority stake in the operation, while Surinamese business owners own 30 percent, and the state owns just 10 percent.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The KSMH never actually owns the precious metal that comes through its doors, according to Ryan Tjon, the director of the KSMH. But Tjon confirms that Kaloti Dubai is one of the buyers of Surinamese gold. Kaloti considered building the Mint House in other countries in the Guiana Shield region, but ultimately chose Suriname due to its long-standing involvement with the country's gold industry. Kaloti's Dubai refinery has imported gold from Suriname since the 1990s.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The Mint House was supposed to turn Suriname into a \"competitive bullion trading hub and center of excellence for the precious metals industry,\" `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"http://www.kalotipm.com/Media-Center-PressReleases-Details/7/KALOTI-OPENS-SURINAMES-FIRST-GOLD-REFINERY\"\n      }}>{`according to Munir Kaloti`}</a>{`, the chairman of Kaloti Precious Metals. The KSMH has a yearly processing capacity of 60,000 kilos of gold—much higher than Suriname’s national annual gold production. Its goal was always to process gold from all of the Guiana Shield countries, but the government failed to promote gold imports from its neighbors and the project has yet to turn a profit.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In 2019, the KSMH processed between 15,000 and 20,000 kilograms of gold, according to Tjon. In theory, that's most of the gold that the country's twelve exporters bought from either small-scale mining operations or from the country's numerous gold shops. But in practice, there are no guarantees that the gold these license holders send to the refinery before exporting is actually mined in Suriname. “It would be very difficult to say where it came from,” Tjon says.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The KSMH is in the position to deny gold if irregularities present themselves; for example, if unusual amounts of gold are moved through the Mint House. Nevertheless, this has not happened in the three years that Tjon has directed the company. The Mint House director is aware that gold trafficking is an issue, “but we are not the ones, the agency, to investigate where the gold actually comes from,” he says. “We are not a police officer.” Instead, the refinery relies on exporters to do their due diligence. If an exporter indicates that it’s Surinamese gold, the KMHS takes it in good faith, according to Tjon.`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`“We are not a police officer.” Instead, the refinery relies on exporters to do their due diligence`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`A lack of oversight at every stage, from the smallest gold shop to the KSMH, has allowed traffickers to launder illegally mined gold into Suriname's legal supply chain. But one reason it’s so hard for authorities to crack down on the illicit trade is that, much like the mercury trade, the trafficking networks for illegally mined gold are always in flux.`}</p>\n    <p><span parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"1200px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<span parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"paddingBottom\": \"66.66666666666666%\",\n            \"position\": \"relative\",\n            \"bottom\": \"0\",\n            \"left\": \"0\",\n            \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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')\",\n            \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          }\n        }}></span>{`\n  `}<picture parentName=\"span\">{`\n        `}<source parentName=\"picture\" {...{\n            \"srcSet\": [\"/static/e290b5d854ae9416aa4900fa84abd977/e93cc/DSC07628.webp 300w\", \"/static/e290b5d854ae9416aa4900fa84abd977/b0544/DSC07628.webp 600w\", \"/static/e290b5d854ae9416aa4900fa84abd977/68fc1/DSC07628.webp 1200w\"],\n            \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\",\n            \"type\": \"image/webp\"\n          }}></source>{`\n        `}<source parentName=\"picture\" {...{\n            \"srcSet\": [\"/static/e290b5d854ae9416aa4900fa84abd977/73b64/DSC07628.jpg 300w\", \"/static/e290b5d854ae9416aa4900fa84abd977/3ad8d/DSC07628.jpg 600w\", \"/static/e290b5d854ae9416aa4900fa84abd977/6c738/DSC07628.jpg 1200w\"],\n            \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\",\n            \"type\": \"image/jpeg\"\n          }}></source>{`\n        `}<img parentName=\"picture\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n            \"src\": \"/static/e290b5d854ae9416aa4900fa84abd977/6c738/DSC07628.jpg\",\n            \"alt\": \"Paramaribo, the Surinamese capital is suffering from the economic crisis since early 2020.\",\n            \"title\": \"Paramaribo, the Surinamese capital is suffering from the economic crisis since early 2020.\",\n            \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"width\": \"100%\",\n              \"height\": \"100%\",\n              \"margin\": \"0\",\n              \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n              \"position\": \"absolute\",\n              \"top\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\"\n            }\n          }}></img>{`\n      `}</picture>{`\n    `}</span>{` `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Paramaribo, the Surinamese capital is suffering from the economic crisis since early 2020.`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`Suriname’s economy took a deep dive after the outgoing Desi Bouterse government raided the Central Bank in February and restricted foreign exchange rates, causing a steep surge in inflation and the economy to nearly collapse.

A more expensive exchange rate for the Euro or USD is applied in Suriname, leading to lower prices for gold, up to 20 percent less than the market price. Another trader claims that the recent changes have pushed the Surinamese gold trade back across the border. “Gold trafficking became attractive again in Suriname,” he says. “Our gold now goes to Guyana,” says another dealer, adding that those who are able to move gold across the border into Guyana can save thousands of U.S. dollars per kilogram.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The new administration in Suriname, headed by President Chan Santokhi, the former chief of police, has promised to reform the country’s gold mining sector, but the country’s new vice president, Ronnie Brunswijk, is a former rebel leader and drug trafficker, and a major player in Suriname’s gold industry, running several mines in the country’s interior. While it’s not unusual for political elites to have a stake in Suriname’s gold mining sector, it remains to be seen if the country can stamp out the black market while those who profit from it are in power.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
